# Notes from week 5



## Examples of visco-elastic rheologies in our research areas (and systems which behave kind of viscoelasticly)
   - GIA -- the mantle is viscos and elastic, the lithosphere is elastic
   - ice sheets on tidal timescales
   - poroelastic deformation in aquifers (the time delayed behavior comes from water flow)
   - firn models which get viscous-like behavior from air flow through the firn. 

## What does 'instantaneous' mean in the context of elastic deformation?

 - its not really instantaneous and all the talk of seismic/sound waves propagating through materials being evidence of them deforming elastically was confusing, because it makes it sound like sounds wave should have infinite speed. 
- what our discussion neglected was the acceleration terms in the equations. 


## Fields
   - scalar fields
   - vector fields

--- add details here, including the usual notation we use for velocoty fields $\vec{u} = (u,v,w)$


## The del operator
$\nabla = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \vec{i} + \frac{\partial}{\partial y} \vec{j} $

----- add divergence and grad here -----

## Relationship between strain rate and velocity fields
$$
\epsilon = \frac{\partial w}{\partial x}
$$

---- add derivation here -----


## Computing the slope of the ice sheet surface from data in the cloud. 

This notebook demonstrates how to compute the gradient field of the ice sheet surface from continent-wide data using cloud computing.
