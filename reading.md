In no particular order, here are some useful resources on ice sheet modelling.

- chapter 3 of this guide to the ice sheet model CISM, goes throough the fundamental equations of ice sheet modellin gvery quickly 
   - https://cism.github.io/data/cism_documentation_v2_1.pdf
- this paper summarizes many other related equations in less mathematical detail, but with lots of helpful discussion
   - https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/12/387/2019/#section7
- this paper is a broad summary of ice sheet modelling (from 2012, so maybe out of date)
